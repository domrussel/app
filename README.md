# Flagship Public University Affordability by State
A simple interactive dashboard that shows measures related to change in two quantities from 1970 to 2017, by state: **median household income** and **in-state tuition at the flagship public university**. Each metric is provided in terms of 2017 dollars, using the CPI to adjust for inflation. The two data sources used to construct the main dataset, all_changes.rds, are:
- **Household income data** from the 1980 US Census and 2017 American Community Survey
- **In-state tuition and mandatory fees data** from the [Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS)](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data)
